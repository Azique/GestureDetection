Basic Gesture Detection
===========

This program uses Python 2 and OpenCV 2 to attempt to detect the user's hand gestures. Gestures can be mapped to different actions and new gestures can be trained.

Currently works best in low lighting.

Yet to be implemented:

~ Gesture determination

~ Gesture training

~ Better hand/center detection

~ Finger detection
